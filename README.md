Pidgin integration plugin for Anki
==================================

Minimal implementation of Pidgin integration. No configuration or error checking yet. Requires Pidgin to be compiled with dbus and the Python dbus bindings to be installed. This is the default on Ubuntu, for other OSes this plugin may be difficult to use.

The same concept could be extended to other applications which monopolize the user's attention for a predetermined length of time, eg. watching movies with mplayer.
